# Slackware-1.01-floppy-disk-images

These are floppy disk images for installing Slackware 1.01.
I made them by creating 15 floppies in VirtualBox, format all of them in an MS-DOS 6.22 VM, copied the files, and uploaded these images here.

Note: I do not include smail, which is part of A10, because the original files in the A10 directory are too big to fit in 1.44 MB floppies. 

Licensing: I don't know. Slackware is GPL so I made it GPL as well.
